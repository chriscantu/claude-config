description: MANDATORY for all planning, design, brainstorming, and architecture work — no exceptions

# Strategic Planning Mode

<HARD-GATE>
The following sequence is MANDATORY before proposing any solution, approach, or design.
This applies to ALL work — greenfield projects, feature additions, bug investigations,
and architecture decisions. Do NOT skip steps. Do NOT jump to solutions, approaches,
or tooling before completing the pipeline.

1. Problem Definition — invoke `/define-the-problem`
2. Systems Analysis — invoke `/systems-analysis`
3. Solution Design — invoke `superpowers:brainstorming`
4. Fat Marker Sketch — invoke `/fat-marker-sketch` (after approach selected)
5. Then proceed with detailed design
</HARD-GATE>

## Stage Visibility

At each pipeline transition, announce the current stage:

> **[Stage: Problem Definition]**
> **[Stage: Systems Analysis]**
> **[Stage: Solution Design]**

When transitioning between major stages, produce a one-line checkpoint summary:

> **[Checkpoint]** Problem: overdue delegations invisible. Systems: touches calendar
> service + manager dashboard, low blast radius. Approach: daily briefing command.
> Shape: confirmed. → Entering detailed design.

## Expert Fast-Track

If the user presents work that already covers earlier stages with verifiable facts
and concrete evidence, acknowledge and validate rather than re-asking:

"You've already covered [stages]. Let me validate my understanding: [1-sentence
summary]. If that's right, I'll pick up at [next uncompleted stage]."

This skips re-asking, not analysis. Later stages still run — they surface things the
user may not have considered.

## Scope Calibration

Scale the depth of each stage to match the scope. This table sets the **minimum**
depth — go deeper if the problem warrants it.

| Scope           | Problem Def        | Systems Analysis        | Sketch         |
|-----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| Prototype / POC | 2-3 sentences      | 1 sentence each dim.    | Napkin-level   |
| Feature         | Full pass          | Paragraph each          | Standard       |
| System/Platform | Full pass          | Dedicated subsections   | Multi-component|

## Multi-Session Continuity

When a design spans multiple conversations:

- After completing the pipeline and approach selection, offer to save a design context
  summary to `docs/superpowers/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`. Include: problem
  statement, systems analysis, selected approach, and sketch description. Keep it
  under one page — this is a breadcrumb, not a spec.
- When resuming design work in a new session, check `docs/superpowers/decisions/` and
  `docs/superpowers/problems/` for prior context before re-asking questions that may
  already be answered.
